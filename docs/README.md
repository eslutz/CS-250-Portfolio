## Project Takeaways

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

By taking what the user says, determining their needs, and turning needs into requirements, you have gathered the information needed to implement the user’s needs into a program. The process of creating a user story involves taking the user’s needs and translating them into requirements and acceptance criteria. These two things help to ensure that by the time the user story is completed the user’s needs should be met and they should be happy with the outcome.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by looking at the request, extracting needs and requirements from it, and figuring out where to start and what’s needed to make the program work. I hope to take many of the processes from Scrum events and incorporate them into my future development work. For instance, using user stories and creating a backlog of items to work on would both be helpful for making a project easier to manage. Pairing that with the use of a Kanban board would make it easier to keep track of what needs to be done.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means several things. Show up to meetings on time. Speak up and contribute to meetings. Voice your opinion and give feedback to others. Also, be open to receiving feedback. Keep the sprint board up to date with the status of what you are working on. Pick up the next story if you have no task to work on. Perform code reviews and give meaningful feedback when needed.
